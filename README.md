This algorithm takes a CSV file containing exoplanet data, reads it into an object, and then trains the model on that object. The model attempts to fit a normal distribution (also known as a bell curve) between the data points, unlike traditional logistic regressions that use a sigmoid function. Using a normal distribution instead of a sigmoid function could increase accuracy and ensure that extremes at both ends are very unlikely to be chosen as exoplanets. Newly discovered exoplanets could be added to the interface.
Our purpose in this project is to improve how we classify exoplanets by using a normal distribution model. With space telescopes like Kepler and TESS generating massive datasets, the challenge isn't just finding exoplanet signals—it's filtering out noise, instrument errors, and false positives. That’s where this model comes in.
It's not just the ML model, but also the interface we’ve built. Users can upload raw data, visualize the model’s predictions, graph the probability curve, and visualize a transit. This makes the tool accessible to researchers who may not be experts in machine learning, while still maintaining the depth needed for scientific analysis.
In summary, this project combines the strengths of probabilistic AI, statistical modeling, and human-centered design to create a powerful and accurate tool for exoplanet classification. By modeling uncertainty and complexity directly, it offers a more realistic and useful approach to one of modern astronomy’s biggest data challenges.
For this project, we hosted the website on GitHub Pages and used HTML for its development. We stored the object inside LocalStorage so it could be persistent across files.
